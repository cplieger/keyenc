 *
 * The TypeScript half of github.com/cplieger/keyenc. It produces
 * byte-identical keys to the Go half for every valid-UTF-8 input, pinned by the
 * shared conformance fixture in `conformance/keys.json`. That parity is
 * load-bearing wherever a key built in one language is looked up against keys
 * built in the other.
 *
 * See the Go package documentation for the grammar, the nesting rule and the
 * reasoning behind the size bound. The short version: `:` separates components
 * and `\` escapes, both escaped element-wise inside every component, so a
 * component carrying a separator cannot shift the split. A component carrying
 * neither is emitted verbatim, which is what lets an existing key adopt this
 * package without changing its bytes.
