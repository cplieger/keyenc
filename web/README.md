# @cplieger/keyenc

> Join several untrusted strings into one key that no field's content can forge.

The TypeScript half of [cplieger/keyenc](https://github.com/cplieger/keyenc). It produces byte-identical keys to the Go half, so a key built here can be looked up against keys built there.

Programs build composite keys constantly: a cache key from a path and a version, a dedupe token from a user and a stream, a render signature from a row's fields. The usual way is a template literal, and that is correct only while no field can contain the separator.

```ts
const key = `${kind}:${host}`; // "gitea" + "git.example.com:3000"
```

When a field can contain it, two different field tuples produce the same key, and every consumer of that key silently merges two things it was built to keep apart. There is no error path: the cache returns the wrong entry, the dedupe token suppresses a distinct action as already in flight, the signature skips a repaint that was needed.

```ts
join("gitea", "git.example.com:3000"); // gitea:git.example.com\:3000
join("a:b", "c") === join("a", "b:c"); // false
```

Zero dependencies. No DOM APIs, so it runs in a browser, in Node and in Deno.

## Install

```sh
npx jsr add @cplieger/keyenc
# or
npm i @cplieger/keyenc
```

## Usage

```ts
import { isHashed, join, split } from "@cplieger/keyenc";

const key = join("streams", userID, ratingKey, audioID, subID);

// Split is join's exact inverse, for a key that gets parsed again.
const [kind, host] = split(forgeID);

// Above MAX_COMPONENT_BYTES a key becomes a fixed-size digest, which is
// one-way. Check before splitting at a site that parses its keys back.
if (isHashed(key)) return;
```

A component containing neither reserved character (`:` and `\`) is emitted verbatim, so a key whose fields are already separator-free encodes byte-identically to its template literal. Adopting this at a key that is currently safe therefore changes nothing, including for a key persisted in `localStorage`.

Calling `split` on a key `join` returned recovers the original parts, as long as `join` did not hash that set. A malformed escape, a backslash before an ordinary character or a trailing backslash, throws `MalformedKeyError` rather than being normalized. A digest, `sha256:` followed by 64 lowercase hex characters, throws `HashedKeyError`, because a hashed identity keeps no components to recover. Any other `sha256:`-prefixed key throws `MalformedKeyError`, because `join` never writes one. `split` does not check the size bound, so a key larger than `join` would hash still splits to its fields.

## Full documentation

The grammar, the nesting rule and the size bound are in [How keyenc encodes a key](https://github.com/cplieger/keyenc/blob/main/docs/how-it-works.md). The cross-language parity contract and the API table are in the [repository README](https://github.com/cplieger/keyenc#readme).
